# Exchange server

This code is a contest entry for [Wood & Co. coding challenge](http://codingchallenge.wood.cz/) implementing
a TCP server for simulating simple stock exchange. It's written in Python 3.5 using _asyncio_ and _ujson_. You can run
it by executing exchange-simulator.py, execute unit tests using `python -m unittest discover` or install into system
using `python setup.py install`.

Complex documentation in Czech language can be found in doc/dokumentace.pdf.
